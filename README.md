We don't develop for the money, power, fame, or codebabes. We do it **For the Badge.** It all started because of an obsession with two words: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BraveUX/for-the-badge.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/BraveUX/for-the-badge). It all ended with this: _badges, for badges’ sake_.

## Usage

1. Check out all the badges [here](https://forthebadge.com)!

3. Swag out your Github readme.

# All Badges

## MAJOR UPDATE 3/16/2017

All badges have been updated to make use of **FREE** fonts rather than the paid ones we had going on before. As such, you guys are encouraged to design badges of your own and submit them with your pull requests. You can read up on some of the guidelines for submitting badges below. As always, keep it fun!

### Contributing

Edit the list below and submit a pull request. Add to the appropriate category if possible. A \* indicates a custom icon.

### Guidelines for Getting a Badge SVG Approved

If submitting a badge svg, please abide by the following guidelines

* First badge tagline uses the font [**Roboto Medium**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto:500) with `220` character tracking (if using Adobe Illustrator).
* Second badge tagline uses the font [**Montserrat Extra-Bold**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?selection.family=Montserrat:800) with `220` character tracking (if using Adobe Illustrator).
* There should always be `13px` padding on all sides of each tagline.
* **SVG's must have all text and icons converted into outlines to ensure it displays properly for all users.**
* Use color's we've already used or choose something similarly appropriate.

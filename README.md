We don’t develop for the money, power, fame, or codebabes. We do it **For the Badge.** It all started because of an obsession with two words: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BraveUX/forthebadge.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/BraveUX/forthebadge) . It all ended with this: _badges, for badges’ sake_.
